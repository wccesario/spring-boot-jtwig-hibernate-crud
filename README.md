# Spring Boot with JTWIG and Hibernate
A very simple CRUD built with Maven, Spring Boot, using Hibernate as ORM and JTWIG as template engine.


The dump used in this project is at the docs diretory.

This code is merely for sample purposes but I would be happy if this ends up helping somebody.

I'm also open to any suggestions of improvements !
